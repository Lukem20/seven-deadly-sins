            The sin of gluttony, characterized by excessive indulgence and overconsumption, finds expression in various aspects of social media and the technology companies that own them. 
            Firstly, social media platforms facilitate a culture of information overload, where users are bombarded with an overwhelming amount of content on a daily basis. 
            This encourages compulsive scrolling and consumption, as individuals voraciously devour posts, videos, and news updates without restraint. 
            Moreover, the design of social media feeds, with infinite scrolls and autoplay features, encourages users to consume content in excess, feeding into a cycle of mindless consumption and gratification.

            Additionally, the proliferation of addictive design patterns, such as notifications and gamification elements, further exacerbates the tendency towards gluttonous behavior, as users compulsively check their devices for updates and rewards. 
            Furthermore, technology companies exhibit gluttony in their insatiable appetite for user data and market dominance, constantly seeking to expand their reach and accumulate more resources at the expense of user privacy and competition. 
            Overall, the sin of gluttony permeates social media and its ownership, fostering a culture of excess, instant gratification, and unchecked consumption that can have detrimental effects on mental health and well-being.

            Social media platforms capitalize on users' attention as a valuable commodity, employing strategies to maximize engagement and time spent on their platforms. 
            This relentless pursuit of user attention, often driven by advertising revenue models, encourages platforms to prioritize quantity over quality when it comes to content consumption. 
            As a result, users may find themselves inundated with an excess of sensationalist or low-quality content designed to capture their attention rather than provide meaningful value. 
            The accessibility and convenience of social media contribute to a culture of overconsumption, where users can easily access a seemingly endless stream of content at any time. 
            This constant availability of information can lead to compulsive behavior and a lack of moderation in content consumption, as individuals struggle to disconnect from their digital devices and set healthy boundaries around screen time.
