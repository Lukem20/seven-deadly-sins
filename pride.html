            The sin of pride, characterized by excessive self-importance, arrogance, and a desire for admiration and recognition, is evident in various aspects of social media and the technology companies that own them. Firstly, social media platforms foster an environment where individuals can curate and showcase idealized versions of themselves, leading to a culture of narcissism and self-promotion. Users often seek validation and praise through likes, comments, and follower counts, feeding their ego and reinforcing feelings of superiority. Additionally, technology companies exhibit pride in their relentless pursuit of innovation and market dominance, often prioritizing growth and profit over ethical considerations and user well-being.

            This hubris can lead to a sense of entitlement and an unwillingness to acknowledge or address the negative impacts of their platforms, such as the spread of misinformation, privacy breaches, and social polarization. Furthermore, the pursuit of technological advancement and disruption can result in a disregard for traditional values and norms, as companies prioritize their vision of progress over the potential consequences for society. Overall, the sin of pride permeates social media and its ownership, fueling a culture of self-aggrandizement, arrogance, and unchecked ambition that can have detrimental effects on individuals and society as a whole. Prideful attitudes among technology companies may manifest in a resistance to regulation and external oversight. Companies may view attempts to regulate their platforms as affronts to their authority and autonomy, leading to lobbying efforts to undermine regulatory measures and maintain their unchecked power. This prideful stance can hinder progress towards addressing pressing societal issues, such as online harassment, data privacy violations, and the spread of harmful content.

            Social media platforms have given rise to influencer culture, where individuals attain fame, wealth, and influence by cultivating large followings and promoting aspirational lifestyles. This culture fosters a sense of pride and superiority among influencers who bask in the adoration and admiration of their followers. Similarly, users may exhibit pride by idolizing influencers and celebrities, contributing to a culture of celebrity worship and the glorification of material wealth and status. Social media platforms can perpetuate a sense of digital elitism, where users vie for recognition and status based on their online presence and social capital. This elitism breeds pride as individuals strive to maintain an aura of exclusivity and superiority within their digital communities. Moreover, certain features and functionalities of social media platforms, such as verification badges and exclusive clubs, contribute to the perception of hierarchy and reinforce feelings of pride among privileged users.
